# electron-react-template

This repository serves as a starting point for developing Electron applications with React. It provides a lightweight template with preconfigured tools such as Webpack, Babel, React, and Electron.

Configured by Ilyacnt.

## Scripts

The following scripts are available:

-   `build`: Builds the application in production mode using Webpack.
-   `build:main`: Builds the main process using Webpack and development mode configuration.
-   `build:renderer`: Builds the renderer process using Webpack and development mode configuration.
-   `build:all`: Builds both the main and renderer processes by running `build:main` and `build:renderer` scripts.
-   `start`: Builds all processes (`build:all`) and starts the Electron application.

Feel free to modify and expand upon this template to suit your specific project requirements. It provides a foundation for building Electron applications with React while keeping the repository lightweight compared to the [electron-react-boilerplate](https://github.com/electron-react-boilerplate/electron-react-boilerplate).

If you have any questions or suggestions, feel free to reach out.
